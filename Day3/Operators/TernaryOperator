//Ternary operator
console.log(x>y?x:y);  //If x is greater than y it will return x value
                       //And if x is not greater than y it will return y value


 //Example
 var age=20;
 var voteable = (age < 18) ? "Too young":"Old enough";
 console.log(voteable);

 //If age is less than 18 it will return too young and if age is greater than 18 it will return Old enough
